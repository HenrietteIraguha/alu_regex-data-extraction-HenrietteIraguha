Data Extraction 

This project is a Python-based text data extractor that scans a raw text file and automatically extracts:

Email addresses (with masking for privacy)

 URLs (HTTP/HTTPS only)

 Phone numbers (common formats)

 Time values (12-hour and 24-hour formats)

The extracted data is then saved in a clean, structured JSON file.
